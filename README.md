> New Process Core

`RISC-V`五级流水先处理器，预计将支持`RISCV64IMZicsr`指令集。

## Getting Started

First, install mill by referring to the documentation [here](https://com-lihaoyi.github.io/mill).

Second, install verilator by referring to the documentation [here](https://verilator.org/guide/latest/install.html).

To run all tests in this design (recommended for test-driven development):
```bash
make test
```

To generate Verilog:
```bash
make verilog
```

To simulate on verilator:

```bash
make sim
```

If you want to watch the wave generated by verilator:

```bash
make mv
```

**YOU NEED INSTALL GTKWAVE FIRST**

Clean the build directory:

```bash
make clean
```

## Testing

## Change FIRRTL Compiler

You can change the FIRRTL compiler between SFC (Scala-based FIRRTL compiler) and
MFC (MLIR-based FIRRTL compiler) by modifying the `useMFC` variable in `playground/src/Elaborate.scala`.
The latter one requires `firtool`, which is included under `utils/`.
